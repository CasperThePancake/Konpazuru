        <p>Konpazuru is a grid-based puzzle game you can play in your browser. You can also create and share your own levels. The basics are pretty simple: you get to the flag, you win. However, the tiles you encounter will block your path, making your goal to reach the end in the least amount of moves.<br><br>There is no time limit, so take time to think about every move you make! To keep things simple, Konpazuru only contains <u>8 different tiles</u>, but these tiles offer tons of interesting levels to beat. Tiles can also have <u>modifiers</u>, allowing them to communicate with eachother, move in different ways and so much more.<br><br>Finally, you can select from <u>4 themes</u> for your level. Each one is based on one of the four seasons and they have effects on certain tiles' looks and behaviours.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom:5px;"><u>Why play Konpazuru?</u></h2>
        <p>While Konpazuru may look like another grid-based platformer, it's actually an intricate puzzle game that requires a lot of forward thinking. Every move you move advances the level forward: enemies will move, tiles will change, ... this means you'll have to imagine these changes in your head to make the right decision. There is no way to undo a move, so one wrong choice can cost you an extra move!<br><br>With that said, it's pretty clear that Konpazuru is a great puzzle game to test and improve your mental strength and forward-thinking skills. You could compare it to chess, where players simulate every possible move and its consequences in their head to come out victorious.</p>
